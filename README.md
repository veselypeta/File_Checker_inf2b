# Inf2b File Checker



Hi Guys,

I made a handy dandy little script for both Python and MATLAB to check that all the files from the checklist on the website are in your submission folder. It's just a simple python script. You can download it by clicking the green button and following the instructions. 

## To Run

1. Copy it into your submission folder 
2. Open a terminal window and cd to the folder
3. Type `python fileTestScript.py`
4. Enter which language you have used for the coursework.

Note: This will not change any of your files
